An E-commerce site template, implemented with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This is one of my portfolio projects, but I would be pleased if these codes helped others, so I published it as an open-source project. Feel free to explore it, and if you need help, ask me. I will respond as soon as possible.
<p>To support me, please create <strong>Pull request</strong> and give <strong>star‚≠ê</strong> to this repository.<br/>
   I appreciate your support in advance. ‚ù§</p>
